# Throttle-UI

Throttle your development experience with Throttle UI

A free, open source library that provides ready to use UI components that you can easily combine to build responsive web sites.

## Getting Started

Copy and paste the code in the head tag of your html document. So that you can style your components just by adding class names to your html elements.

```
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://throttleui.netlify.app/style.css" />
```
Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:

```<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

   //ThrottleUI CSS
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://throttleui.netlify.app/styles.css" />
   
   <title>Throttle UI </title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <h1>Blazing fast component libary</h1>
